			<h3>John "Doc" Holliday</h3>
			<p>With over 10,000 hours piloting helicopters in the bush and mountains of the Southern Alps for deer recovery and mountain rescue operations, Doc is well qualified to land you and your friends in remote parts of the country that only he knows about. He’ll help you plot your route, drop extra provisions where you want them, and will pick you up when you’re done.</p>

			<h3>Hans Gerhansen</h3>
			<p>Hans has flown almost everything there is to fly. He first took the controls of a small plane at 12 years old, and flew solo when he was 14. After a few years flying “anything, anywhere” he settled into a series of test pilot jobs, but left that because he prefers company when he’s in the air. Hans doesn’t actually own his own plane right now, unless you count the microlight, but you will find him in the pilot’s seat of any of our aircraft. When he’s not skiing, tramping, climbing, hang gliding, or performing with his backup band at a local hotel.</p>

			<p>Not as hardcore as the Stunt Flight, the Aerobatic Flight still involves upside-down manuvers but it also invovles seeing some sights, just upside-down.</p>

			<p>A slow controled fall back to earth in our GLider might be jsut what you're after. You will get to see the most in this flight as it lasts the longest but also because of how slow the glider... glides. This flight is recommended for 3 hours long.</p>
